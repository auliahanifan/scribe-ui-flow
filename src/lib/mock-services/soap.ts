Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or rales. No chest wall tenderness on palpation.`,

Differential includes costochondritis, muscle strain, or atypical presentation of cardiac condition. Low probability for cardiac etiology given age and presentation, but warrants further evaluation.`,

Return precautions for worsening symptoms\n6. Follow-up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms persist\n7. Avoid strenuous activity until cleared`,
